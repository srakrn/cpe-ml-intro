# First Step to Practical Machine Learning

This is a presentation and Jupyter notebooks for the course of **First Step to Practical Machine Learning**, which is a part of knowledge sharing activity held at Department of Computer Engineering, Kasetsart University.

## How to download all the files

I recommend you to use Git. Simply type

```
git clone https://github.com/srakrn/cpe-ml-intro.git
```

to obtain all the files.

If there's any update (of which I might tell you in the session), just simply type `git pull` from the working directory. (Magic!)

Cannot use Git? Not only that you should get the [zipped file of all the materials here](https://github.com/srakrn/cpe-ml-intro/archive/master.zip), but also both of us should feel bad. :(

## Slide

The (LaTeX-compiled) PDF slide could be found in the `slides` folder.

## Notebook files

The course contains some activities, of which Jupyter Notebook, along with the required dependencies, are required.

### Requirements

The notebooks for activities require:

- Python 3.5 - 3.6
- Dependencies, of which could be installed by `pip3 install -r utilities/requirements.txt`

### Checking for the dependencies

- Run `python utilities/reqs_check.py` in order to check if everything is installed. You should not see any "X" signs.
- Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal to see if Jupyter could be run.
